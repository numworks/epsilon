 *   FPU since this function is the first thing called after reset.
 *   We can safely assume that neither memcpy, memset, nor any Ion::Device::init*
 *   method will use floating-point numbers, but ion_main very well can.
 *   To make sure ion_main's potential usage of VFP registers doesn't bubble-up to
 *   start(), we isolate it in its very own non-inlined function call.
 * - To avoid jumping on the external flash when it is shut down, we ensure
 *   there is no symbol references from the internal flash to the external
 *   flash except this jump. In order to do that, we isolate this
 *   jump in a symbol that we link in a special section separated from the
