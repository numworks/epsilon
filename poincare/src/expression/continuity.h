/* WARNING: Everywhere in Poincaré, the term "discontinuity" refers to
 * "jump-discontinuity" (i.e. finite discontinuities like piecewise, random,
 * round, floor, ceil, ...).
 * Infinite/asymptotic discontinuities (like 1/x) are
 * not handled when calling IsDiscontinuousOnInterval or
 * InvolvesDiscontinuousFunction (partly because they are more obvious to detect
 * by numerical algorithms).
 *
 * Jump-discontinuity (handled in this file):
 *      o-----

 * WARNING: The Abs function is also considered to have a jump-discontinuity in
 * zero, as it can cause problems in expressions like "|x|/x".
