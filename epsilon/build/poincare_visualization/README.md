# Poincare visualization

You can visualize the evolution of the poincare treestack by running:
* `make EXECUTABLE=test poincare_log_visualization` to see the evolution accross all unary tests
* `make SCENARIO=tests/calculation/calculation_addition.nws poincare_log_visualization` to see the evolution running a single scenario.


You can also wrap a snippet of code with:
```C++
#include <poincare/src/memory/visualization.h>

/* ... */

ResetLogger();

/* Your code */

CloseLogger();

/* ... */
```

to reduce the visualization only while executing the snippet.
